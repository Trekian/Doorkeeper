# DoorKeeper [Work in Progress]
Discord Bot to manage multiple Team and distributem them into their team channel or get all team members back in one channel.

## What is DoorKeeper about
If you want to organize an online quiz with multiple teams, you can use DoorKeeper as your bot of choice. You can set create own teams or use the random feature. As teams are created you can move each team to an dedicated voicechannel and the teams can discuss internaly. The moderator, who needs to be set first, will be untouched. As soon as the time expires, all players will be moved to the 'presentation voicechannel'. 
Below you will find all commands and how to use them.
