Discord Bot to manage multiple Team and distributem them into their team channel or get all team members back in one channel.

## What is DoorKeeper about
If you want to organize an online quiz with multiple teams, you can use DoorKeeper as your bot of choice. You can create own teams or use the random feature. As teams are created you can move each team to an dedicated voicechannel and the teams can discuss internaly. The moderator, who needs to be set first, will be untouched of moving. As soon as the time expires, all players will be moved to the 'presentation voicechannel'. 

Below you will find all commands and how to use them.

###How to start
**Requirements**: All people who are in a voicechannel are participants for the quiz, so it better to create a new Discord server, so only quiz paricipants will join.
1) Get all people who wants to participate in a **Voicechannel**, so the will recognize as 'active'.
2) Set at least one moderator(s) with _!moderator discord_name1 discord_name2 ..._  
3) Create random teams with _!create_random_teams <Number_of_Teams>_
4) Now initialise the "Game" with _!initialize_
